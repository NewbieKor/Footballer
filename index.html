    The Turing test, originally called the imitation game by Alan Turing in 1950,[2] is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behaviour equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.
    Turing proposed that a human evaluator would judge natural language conversations between a human and a machine designed to generate human-like responses.
    <br><br><br><p>The evaluator would be aware that one of the two partners in conversation is a machine, and all participants would be separated from one another. 
    The conversation would be limited to a text-only channel such as a computer keyboard and screen so the result would not depend on the machine's ability to render words as speech.[3]
    If the evaluator cannot reliably tell the machine from the human, the machine is said to have passed the test. 
    The test results do not depend on the machine's ability to give correct answers to questions, only how closely its answers resemble those a human would give.</p>
